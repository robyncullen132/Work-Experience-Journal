## Week One

# Monday

Today I had my induction to the workplace; 
I met my supervisors/very-friendly-and-really-helpful-people: Jameel, Laura, Judy and Dimitra.
We got a comprehensive tour of the place and visitorsâ€™ cards  from Aoife and were then placed at our work-station, a lovely desk with a view in an open-plan area next to the Ops and Engineering departments.

Our supervisors helped us to set-up GitHub accounts and joined us to the Slack workplace. They set us a project: make a cordova timetable app using our skills in HTML and my knowledge of CSS.

I was surprised and impressed that there was already a programme of crash courses and projects ready for us and grateful that everyone was so kind and willing to talk to me about their experiences and to answer any questions I had. The day was jam-packed with activities and learning-experiences and I definitely enjoyed myself.
